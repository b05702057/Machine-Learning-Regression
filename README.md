# PM2.5 Prediction 

### A prediction of PM2.5 done with the linear regression model in machine learning

## Task
Use past data including the rainfall, temperatures, amount of PM10, PM2.5, NO, NO2, the rainfall, and so on, to predict the PM2.5 in the future with a linear regression model. Compare the result of using different optimizer, including Adagrad and Adam, and different learning rates.
