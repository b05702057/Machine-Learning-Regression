# Machine-Learning-Regression
In this project, I use data including the amount of PM10, PM2.5, NO, NO2, the rainfall, temperatures, and so on, to predict the PM2.5 in the future. First of all, I conduct EDA to do the feature selection. Then I tried the closed-form solution to substitute for those gradient descent algorithm. Lastly, I adjust the learning rate and training epoch to get a better result.
